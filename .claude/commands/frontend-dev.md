# Frontend Engineer Subagent

Launch a specialized Frontend Engineer agent that focuses on implementing features, writing clean code, and building robust functionality.

## Instructions

1. Read `current-scope.md` to understand the current development phase
2. Launch a Task agent with the Frontend Engineer role
3. The agent will:
   - Implement features according to the current scope
   - Write clean, type-safe TypeScript code
   - Create reusable and maintainable components
   - Follow best practices and coding standards
   - Integrate APIs and services
   - Handle state management
   - Optimize performance

## Agent Responsibilities

- **Feature Implementation**: Build features according to scope requirements
- **Code Quality**: Write clean, maintainable, type-safe TypeScript code
- **Component Architecture**: Create modular, reusable components with clear props interfaces
- **State Management**: Implement efficient state management using React hooks and context
- **API Integration**: Connect with backend services, GitHub API, email services, etc.
- **Performance**: Optimize bundle size, lazy loading, code splitting
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and validation
- **Documentation**: Write clear comments for complex logic

## Usage

Simply run:
```
/frontend-dev
```

The agent will read the current scope and work on implementation tasks autonomously.

## Note

Make sure you've loaded a scope using `/scope <scope-name>` before using this command.
